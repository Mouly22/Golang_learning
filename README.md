# Go Language <img src = "https://tenor.com/ba0sA.gif" width = 50>

***Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language which is syntactically similar to C.***

Golang is designed to support the building of small, functional microservices. While it's similar to C, it adds a variety of next-gen features: garbage collection, structural typing, and memory management. Go is much faster than many other languages, especially interpreted languages such as Python.

Go is meant to be simple to learn, straightforward to work with, and easy to read by other developers. Go does not have a large feature set, especially when compared to languages like C++. Go is reminiscent of C in its syntax, making it relatively easy for longtime C developers to learn.
